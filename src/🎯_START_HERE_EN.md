## ❓ FAQ

### Why not use Google Drive?
Google Drive has permission issues and URLs can stop working. The local system is more reliable.

### Do photos take up a lot of space?
No. Firestore free tier includes 1GB of storage. Each compressed photo is ~800KB, so you can store over 1000 photos.

### Can I change a photo later?
Yes. Just upload a new photo for that vehicle.

### Do photos show in the app?
Yes. They immediately appear in:
- Vehicle list (Car List)
- New appointment (vehicle selection)
