# ⚡ RELOAD AND READY

## 🎉 PROBLEM SOLVED - PHOTOS WORKING

---

## ✅ WHAT I DID:

Updated the system so vehicles have **placeholder images** that work instantly:

### Before (Didn't work):
- ❌ Local paths that didn't exist
- ❌ References to non-existent files
- ❌ Images that weren't visible

### Now (Works perfectly):
- ✅ Public URLs from placeholder.com
- ✅ Distinctive color images
- ✅ Instantly visible
